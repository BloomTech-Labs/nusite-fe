cd [repo]
npm install
npm start
```

#### [Back end](https://partnerd-staging.herokuapp.com/) built using:

-  [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
-  [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.com/)
-  [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)
-  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

#### GraphQL framework and API

#### Staging Backend delpoyed at [Heroku](https://partnerd-staging.herokuapp.com/) <br>

#### Master Backend delpoyed at [Heroku](https://partnerd-master.herokuapp.com/) <br>

## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

-  Clone this repo
-  **npm install** to install all required dependencies
-  \*\*npm run build to build only if you would like to run the start script, otherwise:

-  **npm run server** to start the local server
-  **npm test** to start server using testing environment
-  **npm run coverage** to see test coverage

### Backend frameworks

Node, Express, TypeScript, GraphQL, Apollo-Server

-  TypeScript to make a theoretically less error prone backend
-  GraphQL for it's performance
-  Apollo-Server is used to help communicate with the frontend of the application

## Endpoints

With the nature of GraphQL, you will only have one endpoint, with the exception of the welcome route

| Method | Endpoint   | Description                           |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/`        | all users                             | Welcome route to the API |
| POST   | `/graphql` | graphql endpoint to test your queries |

## Other Scripts

    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs all of the tests in __tests__ directory and prints out a test coverage report
    * testDev - runs tests with `--watch`, so devs can get immediate feedback on changes

#### Pull Request Guidelines

-  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
-  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new plist variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
-  Ensure that your code conforms to our existing code conventions and test coverage.
-  Include the relevant issue number, if applicable.
-  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
